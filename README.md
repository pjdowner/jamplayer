# jamPlayer

This is a project to make a music player for musicians, guitarists mainly, at the moment this directory contains the basis for the project with a few gstreamer examples. The directory you want to look at is jamplayer_qt which has a working version of the software i.e. it opens a plays back music files, can slow them down or speed up and adjust the pitch. It also has support for the line 6 FBV Express MKII foot pedal via midi with libDrumstick.

Currently the code is a bit of a mess, and is really a kludge of several bits of demo code from libDrumstick and gstreamer. A rewrite should happen soon.
