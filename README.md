# jamPlayer

Note: this code is horrible, it's full of bugs and reading it will probably make you claw your eyeballs out with terror. It's slowly going to get better I'm just concentrating on adding more bugs^Wfeatures at the moment.

This is a project to make a music player for musicians, guitarists mainly, which can slow down music without altering the pitch, alter the pitch, loop sections and be controlled by a midi foot controller. This project is in a complete rewrite at the moment, so a lot of bugs and user interface issues. If you want a basic but working version check out the 'old' branch.
