# jamPlayer

This is a project to make a music player for musicians, guitarists mainly, which can slow down music without altering the pitch, alter the pitch, loop sections and be controlled by a midi foot controller. This project is in a complete rewrite at the moment, so a lot of bugs and user interface issues. If you want a basic but working version check out the 'old' branch.
